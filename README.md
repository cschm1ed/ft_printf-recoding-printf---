## Learning Outcomes

    Variadic Functions: Acquired skills in using variadic functions, which allow functions to accept a variable number of arguments of varying data types.
    Static Libraries: Gained experience in managing multiple static libraries within a single project.
    Function Implementation: Mastered the implementation of a custom printf() function, understanding the essential aspects of displaying text and             variables embedded in text.

## The ft_printf function handles the following conversions:

    %c: Displays a single character.
    %s: Displays a string.
    %i, %d: Display integer variables in decimal format.
    %u: Displays unsigned integer variables in decimal format.
    %x, %X: Display unsigned integer variables in hexadecimal format, in upper- or lower-case.
    %p: Displays a pointer in hexadecimal format.
    %%: Displays a single percent-sign.

Like the original printf() function, ft_printf() returns the number of characters it displayed.

## Implementation Rules

    Allowed functions include write, malloc, free, exit, and any equivalent functions coded during the project.
    A Makefile is provided to compile the source files without relinking.
    Global variables are forbidden.

Through ft_printf, I gained practical experience in working with variadic functions and managing static libraries in a C project.
